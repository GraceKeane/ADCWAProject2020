## Introduction
Advanced data centric web applications project 2020. For this project I used Spring Boot MVC, java, HTML and CSS to implement an order tracking system. It allows users to view all products, orders ect and allows correct additional information to be added to the database. I have added functions to this application which allows for security to be set and followed throughout. Controllers, Services, Repositories and Views were created in order for this application to work simultaneously.

## Arcitecture
*The spring boot applications contains & allows...*
* Data that can be read from a database
* Info from database that can be displayed on the web in a table format
* Data added to a database using spring forms
* Spring error messages can be displayed
* Spring security throughout the application
* Table joins
* Table headers
* Table designs
* Input data forms

### Useful mySQL Commands
* show databases; - displays all databases created
* use <DatabaseName> - selects a certain database to work with
* Use <DatabaseNameHere>- selects the database in which to use
* CREATE TABLE <TableNameHere> (PersonID int, FirstName varchar(255)); - creates a table vith colume values of PersonID & FirstName
* select * from <DatabaseNameHere> - displays information in a specific table
* insert into <TableName> values (1, "John"); - inserts specific data into the table
* date varchar(255) - insert a date into a table
